### Anonymizing proxy  
#### Anonymizing proxies allow the user to hide their web browsing activity. They are often used to bypass web security filters—e.g., to access blocked sites from a work computer.
Anonymizing proxies hold security and liability risks for organizations:  
Security: The anonymizing proxy bypasses web security and allows users to access unauthorized webpages  
Liability: Organizations can be legally liable if their computers are used to view pornography, hate material or to incite illegal behavior. There are also ramifications if users violate third-party licenses through illegal MP3, film and software downloads
