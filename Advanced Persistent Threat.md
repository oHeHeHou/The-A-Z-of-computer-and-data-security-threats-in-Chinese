###Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
####An advanced persistent threat is a type of targeted attack. APTs are characterized by an attacker who has time and resources to plan an infiltration into a network.
These attackers actively manage their attack once they have a foothold in a network and are usually seeking information, proprietary or economic, rather than simple financial data. APTs are persistent in that the attackers may remain on a network for some time. APTs should not be confused with botnets, which are usually opportunistic and indiscriminate attacks seeking any available victim rather than specific information.

###高级持续威胁
高级持续威胁是一种有针对性的攻击。APT的特点在于攻击者有时间和资源去策划一场网络攻击。攻击者一旦在网络上有了一个立足点，他们通常会去组织攻击，寻求信息，拥有权，或者经济方面的(信息)；而不是简单的有价值的数据。攻击者会在网络上停留一段时间，所以APT是持久的。APT不应该和僵尸网络混淆。
僵尸网络会随机并泛滥地攻击受害者，而APT指定具体对象。
